A fictional music club website made for a college assignment

In year 1 semester 2 I was tasked with creating a website for an assignment and I chose to make one for a fictional music club.
We had to use Semantic UI so I followed a typical design for a website using this framework for the best results.
I included as many Semantic UI elemets as I could for a higher grade, such as breadcrumbs and a carousel. 

For year 2 semester 1, I had to get the website but add javascript interactivity.
